# Red-C nextflow pipeline

## Introduction

Welcome to Red-C RNA-DNA interactome mapping with [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).

Red-C is a novel method for genome-wide detection of RNA-DNA interactions in chromatin.
The details are in our [NAR paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa457) from 09 July, 2020:

Petrova, N.V., Logacheva, M.D., Kantidze, O.L., Ulianov, S.V. and Magnitov, M.D., 2020. 
Studying RNAâ€“DNA interactome by Red-C identifies noncoding RNAs associated with various chromatin 
types and reveals transcription dynamics.

The initial pipeline (RedClib) was implemented in Python and was hard to scale. 
From now on, we support the **nextflow pipeline redc-nf**. 

Pros:
  - You can easily change the parameters of run. 
  - The data processing is parallel and scalable. 
  - No need to re-run from scratch due to nextflow [resume](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html) functionality. 
  - You can switch off unneded processing steps. 

Cons: none detected

## System requirements

1. You need a system supporting nextflow pipelines. For example, you can create conda environment with nextflow, 
   which will contain redc-nf dependencies:

```
conda env create -n redc-nf -f environment.yml 
conda activate redc-nf
conda install -c bioconda nextflow
```
   
2. Run test example:

```
nextflow redc.nf -params-file project.yml
```

This example should take up to 1 minute. 
you may want to check that the results are the same as we provide in `test/` folder. 

3. Adjust `project.yml` for your needs. You may vary libraries, 
   input files, genome, RNA annotation, restriction enzymes, filters, 
   output files and their content, 
   chunk size for splitting the data, oligos and trimming parameters. 
   
`project.yml` has inline documentation that should explain the details. 

4. Check out the results of mapping and annotation of your RNA-DNA contacts. 
   In case of troubles, visit and improve our [issues page](https://github.com/agalitsyna/RedClib/issues).

## RedClib description

This is outdated pipeline description of RedClib, but might provide some hints on the inner 
structure of redc-nf pipeline:
